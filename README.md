# Pew! Pew! Pew!
I'm cherry-picking patches here that I want for O_C-Phazerville, such as 48khz Audio, multi-channel USB, and MTP Disk support.

Trying to avoid merge commits for a clean, readable history, so some changes are applied as a single squashed commit from elsewhere. I will rebase on upstream when it's updated and then force-push.
